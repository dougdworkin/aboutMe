    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a front end designer and developer for a large health care provider, creating event microsites and overseeing event communications.</p>

    <p>I am also an illustrator who specializes in childrenâ€™s books.</p>

    <P>I really like to learn new things and enjoy experiences that expose me to different ideas. I know there is always a better way to do something and I love finding out ways to get to the next level in my work.</P>

    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the Washington, DC area. I still miss its amazing museums. Although, I really enjoyed the art and culture, one of my favorite places to be was with the dinosaurs in the Natural History Museum.</p>

    <h2>A Little More Information</h2>

    <h3>Favorite Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Besides drawing, I really like to sculpt and I have little monsters I've created all around my workspace at home.</p>

    <p>I'm also an avid hiker and try to take advantage of the incredible walks along the coastal ridges and redwood forests where I live.</p>

    <h3>My Dream Job</h3>
    <p>It would be amazing if I was involved with designing and/or developing websites for kids. It would the perfect mix for me to combine my children's illustration with what I am doing for a living.</p>

    <h3>Music I've Been Listening to Lately</h3>
    <p>I tend to be stuck in a music time bubble of anything produced pre-2000 (specifically the 80s and 90s). I have found myself listening to Yo-Yo Ma's album "Bach Cello Suites" while I work lately.</p>
